== Extend Ingest Client using Plugins

=== Create Project
Create a new maven project with dependency to GenericRepoClient. Implement a class
implementing the IMetadata4Ingest interface.

==== Edit pom.xml
To register a new plugin the pom.xml has to be prepared like the following:

[source,xml]
--------------------------------------
<plugin>
  <groupId>eu.somatik.serviceloader-maven-plugin</groupId>
  <artifactId>serviceloader-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.7</version> 
  <configuration> 
    <services>
      <param>edu.kit.dama.rest.client.ingest.IMetadata4Ingest</param>
    </services>
  </configuration> 
  <executions> 
    <execution>
      <goals> 
        <goal>generate</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution> 
  </executions> 
</plugin>

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>edu.kit.dama.rest</groupId>
    <artifactId>GenericRepoClient</artifactId>
    <version>1.5</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
--------------------------------------

=== Register Plugin
Thatâ€™s it. Now you may build and add the jar file in the lib directory
and start GenericRepoClient.

=== Existing Plugins
There exists one example plugin which is ready to use in the plugins folder.
Please copy the jar file from plugins to lib folder.
Next time an ingest is started a Dialog will appear for each folder querying
for title and note of the digital object. 

NOTE: There should be only one plugin at once in lib folder!

=== Sample Code

see 
link:code\DialogPlugin4Ingest.java[Java code]

== Drag'n Drop Client (Windows)
There is also a drag'n drop client for Windows located in the bin folder (DragAndDropClient.bat). 
It's not possible to move the file to another location but shortcuts are allowed. 
Creating a shortcut of this file on desktop may be most convenient. 
(Drag'n drop file to desktop while pressing ALT-Key.)

=== Requirements
NOTE: For ingesting digital objects the connections to the repository and to webDAV
have to be initialized in beforehand. Therefore the command **bin/setupRepo init -a**
has to be executed at least once.
To test the settings use the command **bin/setupRepo init -a -d** (For more details
see <<init>>)

=== Usage
It's possible to ingest directories to repository by dropping them on the batch
file or its shortcut. Only directories are allowed and each selected directory 
will be registered as digital object.
If there are any errors please consult the console or the log file located in the
log directory.

NOTE: While using drag'n drop client there should be a plugin installed. Otherwise all
digital objects will have the same note.
